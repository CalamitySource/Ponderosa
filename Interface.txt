~~~READ DIS YO: The following may seem like a lot, and some of it 
will sound like just odd arbitrary trivia that doesnt seem very 
relevant, but I feel that by having access to so much fun and
interesting trivia will create a unique atmosphere to the game, 
and allow players to connect with the game on a subconsciencely
deeper level, they will become more attached to Crew members if 
they know their name and how many years they've been in service,
things of that nature, aside from that, having so much information
at your disposal within mere clicks will give it that Space-Age
tone this game should have~~~

The picture of the HUD is designed so that at face value it
looks very simple and plain, but can quickly get complex

 Player Health Bar

 NO SHIP HEALTH BAR ~ (ship damage will be displayed visually)
 ((Fires, cracks, warning lights))

 Will need a "flower" type menu for:
 *Manual Control Node
 *Manual Defense Node
 *Space Stations

------------

 Starchart, click this to bring up your map of the known
 universe, can zoom in to see Solar Systems, and can further
 zoom in to see properties and such.
 YOU map out your own StarChart, the map will be filled in
 as you travel/explore. Places/areas you have been will ALWAYS
 be revealed on your map forever.
 
 Minimap

-----------
(This is a bubble menu, it seporates into the two buttons
when you press it, which you can then click, after left
alone for a second the two buttons will come together again)

 Purchase Menu, this menu is where you buy all ship upgrades and
 property improvements. 
 *Upgrades
 *Property Improvements
 (Upgrades are only purchased at friendly/ally Space Stations)
 ((Property Improvements are only available while ON a player
 owned property that belongs to you, otherwise grayed out))
(((When the Menu is pressed it automatically brings up the menu
that is relative to what you're doing, meaning when you press
purchase menu and you're standing on your property it will only
bring up the Property Improvement shop)))
((((Works same way with Space Stations/Upgrades))))

 Social Tab, brings up friend/ignore window.

----------

 Main Menu Button

----------

 I really wanted to incorperate some form of Galactic News, which
was some sort of scrawl across the top of the screen or somewhere
that constantly displayed some sort of news. Under it would be an
Emergency Channel that displayed information that is immediately
relevant to the player right NOW.

Example:
"In today's news Planet "Mashed-Potatoes" celebrated its 1 year
aniversary today, located in the Peanut-Butter System, this 
planet was the 4th colonized planet of the sector..."
~~WARNING: YOUR PROPERTY "H4xz0r5" WAS HIT BY AN ASTEROID~~

---------

 Five Info Buttons that bring up Information Menus.
1. Economy
2. Resource
3. Colonizing
4. Ship & Crew
5. Union (Grayed out until you join a Union)

(1) Economy Menu will display your overall net worth, counting
all the money you put into your Properties & your current money.
Other Character/Money related information here.

(2) Resource Menu will display a small icon of every property you
own, and you can click it, and it will display all resources you
have taken FROM that property.

(3) Colonizing Menu will display all your colonized properties and
allow you to click on them for various information.

(4) Ship & Crew menu will display all ships, and crew information.
Also allows you to manage your crew and assign them to different 
ships, this is purely for Auto-Trades.

(5) Union Menu will display all information relevant to your Union.
